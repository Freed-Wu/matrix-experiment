  abstract = {Abstract We consider linear equations y = Œ¶x where y is a given vector in ‚Ñùn and Œ¶ is a given n √ó m matrix with n < m ‚â§ œÑn, and we wish to solve for x ‚àà ‚Ñùm. We suppose that the columns of Œ¶ are normalized to the unit ùìÅ2-norm, and we place uniform measure on such Œ¶. We prove the existence of œÅ = œÅ(œÑ) > 0 so that for large n and for all Œ¶'s except a negligible fraction, the following property holds: For every y having a representation y = Œ¶x0 by a coefficient vector x0 ‚àà ‚Ñùm with fewer than œÅ ¬∑ n nonzeros, the solution x1 of the ùìÅ1-minimization problem \$\${\rm min} \|x\|\_{1} \;\;{subject \; to}\;\; \Phi x = y\$\$ is unique and equal to x0. In contrast, heuristic attempts to sparsely solve such systems‚Äîgreedy algorithms and thresholding‚Äîperform poorly in this challenging setting. The techniques include the use of random proportional embeddings and almost-spherical sections in Banach space theory, and deviation bounds for the eigenvalues of random Wishart matrices. ¬© 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
